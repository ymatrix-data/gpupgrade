	// all the binaries, gpupgrade_hub and gpupgrade_agent included, would be alongside each other.
	// But in our integration tests' context, only the necessary Golang code is compiled, and Ginkgo's default
	// is to compile gpupgrade_hub and gpupgrade_agent in separate directories. As such, this test depends on the
	// setup in `integrations_suite_test.go` to replicate the real-world scenario of "install binaries side-by-side".

	// TODO: This test might be interesting to run multi-node; for that, figure out how "installation" should be done
