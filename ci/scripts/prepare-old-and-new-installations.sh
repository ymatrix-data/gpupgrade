# Performs pre-upgrade cluster fixups to prepare for upgrade. This includes the
# installation of the new GPDB binary, if it is different from the old GPDB
# binary, and the creation of -old and -new symlinks so that future pipeline
# tasks don't have to know the exact versions in use.
#
# Expected pipeline inputs:
# - cluster_env_files, for SSH setup
# - rpm_gpdb_new, containing the new GPDB RPM to install IF the old and new
#   packages are different
