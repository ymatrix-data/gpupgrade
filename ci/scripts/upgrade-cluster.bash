# make_trampoline_directories() is a temporary workaround for this problem.
#
# It sets up a fake binary directory, for both the old and new clusters, that
# contains a set of symbolic links to the necessary executables. The trampoline
# binary will set PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH as if we had sourced greenplum_path,
# then call the actual executable with the provided arguments. This way we can
# avoid polluting the environment with either the old or new link paths; they're
# set just-in-time.
